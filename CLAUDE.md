# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for repository guidelines, architecture, commands, and conventions.

## Important

Always write non-Claude-specific rules (Python coding style, testing guidelines, project conventions, etc.) to AGENTS.md, not this file. CLAUDE.md is only for Claude Code-specific instructions. AGENTS.md is the shared source of truth for all AI coding agents.
