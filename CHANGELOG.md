# Changelog

All notable changes to `binlecode/actop` should be documented in this file.

This project follows a Keep a Changelog-style format and uses version tags for releases.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- `docs/DESIGN-system.md` §3.7: documents `soc_profiles.py`'s SoC-profile
  resolution and fallback design (exact match → generation-agnostic tier
  fallback via `APPLE_M_SERIES_PATTERN` → generic catch-all), including why a
  dynamic voltage-state-derived power estimator was considered and rejected.
- `docs/DESIGN-system.md` §1.1: records the stand-alone-binary
  (Nuitka/PyInstaller) rejection rationale — PyPI + Homebrew already cover the
  "no Python hassle" audience.
- README: a `## Python API` section with a verified `Profiler`/`to_pandas()`
  snippet — previously only mentioned in prose, no runnable example existed.
- `docs/TODO-architecture-roadmap.md`: fresh roadmap. Prior round (kernel-offset
  pinning, memory-stability guard, memory-bandwidth sampling, cross-platform
  ctypes guards, headless export) shipped in full and is retired from tracking.
  New must-have items (fan RPM via SMC, net/disk I/O via native ctypes) and a
  deferred low-priority item (menu bar mode, explicitly after first
  market-promo push per `docs/RUNBOOK-launch-and-growth.md`).
- `.claude/skills/run-actop`: documents driving the TUI via tmux send-keys/
  capture-pane for manual verification (Homebrew binary and local `.venv` dev
  build), including the sampler-init ready marker and how to confirm live
  updates vs. a static frame.
- `docs/DESIGN-system.md` §3.5: folds the DCS-bandwidth spike findings in
  directly (PMP/DCS BW group, residency-histogram semantics, channel-to-agent
  mapping, the per-agent 32 GB/s cap finding, the state-extraction cost-control
  filter); the standalone spike doc is retired.

### Fixed
- `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`: removed stale `psutil` references.
  The native-polling migration (RAM/swap/process enumeration via `native_sys.py`
  ctypes) was already complete in code; the docs never caught up. Also dropped
  `CLAUDE.md`'s dead pointer to the already-deleted `TODO-native-polling.md`.
- `docs/DESIGN-system.md`: fixed two dead cross-references to already-deleted
  or about-to-be-deleted TODO files (inlined the relevant facts instead).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Per-process GPU attribution** — the `PWR` column now covers GPU, not just CPU.
  A new `gpu_registry.py` module reads per-pid `accumulatedGPUTime` off each
  `AGXDeviceUserClient` via IOKit, sudoless. `utils.get_top_processes()` exposes
  a `gpu_time_share` alongside the existing `cpu_time_share`, and
  `utils.attribute_power()` combines both into the final watts value used by
  `PWR` and `SORT_POWER`. Completes Tier 2 of the feature-gap roadmap. Documented
  in `DESIGN-system.md` §5.7.
- `scripts/ane_load.py` — a CoreML-based Apple Neural Engine load generator for
  verifying that the ANE gauge reports power/percent correctly (the ANE reads
  `0% (0.0W)` when idle because it is power-gated). Builds an fp16 conv stack in
  memory, pins compute units to CPU+ANE, and loops inference.
- New `ane` optional-dependencies extra (`coremltools`, `numpy`) for the load
  generator. Kept out of the `dev` extra so Linux CI (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`)
  stays lean and unaffected.
- README: DVFS residency comparison row, a Troubleshooting FAQ entry explaining
  the expected idle `ANE 0%` reading, and a Development note documenting the
  `ane` extra + `scripts/ane_load.py`.

### Fixed
- Guarded native `ctypes` library loads in `gpu_registry.py`, `smc.py`, and
  `ioreport.py` under `sys.platform == "darwin"` (matching `native_sys.py`'s
  existing pattern) — an unguarded load in `gpu_registry.py` was crashing
  `import actop` on non-Darwin, breaking CI's `ubuntu-latest` matrix.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Thermal-throttle indicator (`THROTTLING:CPU`/`:GPU`)** — the last Tier-1
  differentiator. The status line now says explicitly when a silicon domain is being
  throttled *right now*: it fires per domain (P-cluster CPU, GPU) on a "busy + slow +
  hot" rule — utilization ≥ 80% AND current frequency below
  `--alert-throttle-freq-percent`% (default 90) of the domain's DVFS max frequency AND
  thermal pressure elevated (or die temp ≥ 90°C) — sustained over
  `--alert-sustain-samples` frames. Fully read-only. Documented in the `?` help overlay.
- New `--alert-throttle-freq-percent` CLI flag (default 90).
- `SystemSnapshot` gains `ecpu_max_freq_mhz` / `pcpu_max_freq_mhz` / `gpu_max_freq_mhz`
  (the per-domain DVFS ceiling, sourced from the frequency table the sampler already
  discovers), so the throttle ratio is computable through the public API.

### Changed
- Renamed the memory-bandwidth saturation alert token from `BW>N%` to
  **`MEM-BOUND>N%`** (status line + `?` help overlay) so the indicator reads as the
  "am I memory-bandwidth-bound?" decision signal it was designed to be. No change to
  the underlying threshold, sustain logic, or `--alert-bw-sat-percent` flag.
- Docs: marked roadmap feature #2 (bandwidth as % of SoC reference + `MEM-BOUND`
  indicator) as **shipped** in `docs/TODO-actop-feature-gap-roadmap.md`, recording the
  as-built normalisation (summed CPU+GPU channel refs, not a separate
  `peak_bandwidth_gbps` field) and the token rename. Updated the matching
  `docs/DESIGN-system.md` references.
- Docs: rewrote roadmap feature #3 (thermal-throttle indicator) into an
  implementation-ready spec — locked the "busy + slow + hot" detection rule, corrected
  the max-frequency source (DVFS table, not `soc_profiles.py`), flagged the
  `throttled_count` memory-counter red herring, and enumerated the required
  `SystemSnapshot`/config/CLI plumbing and functional test.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-01 08:16:26

### Changed
- Documentation only (no runtime code changes):
  - Renamed `docs/GUIDE-launch-and-growth.md` to `docs/RUNBOOK-launch-and-growth.md` to
    align with the `RUNBOOK-` doc prefix convention.
  - `DESIGN-system.md`: folded in the shipped per-process power (`PWR`) feature — new
    §5.7 (attribution model, reconciliation token, P-vs-E estimate caveat), corrected
    §3.5 (per-process CPU power *is* attributed since v1.0.2; GPU/ANE/true-energy are
    not), documented the `(pid, start_tvsec)` PID-reuse guard in §2.3, and updated the
    sort-cycle (`CPU% → PWR → RSS → PID`) and the layout mock.
  - `RUNBOOK-launch-and-growth.md`: reconciled the Homebrew-notability bar with the
    design doc (was a conflicting figure), noted the repo is pre-launch, marked the
    README Quick Start done, fixed the r/LocalLLaMA `brew tap` one-liner, and refreshed
    the release-cadence note to 1.0.x.
  - Deleted `docs/TODO-t1-per-process-power.md` (the flagship feature shipped in v1.0.2;
    its as-built design now lives in `DESIGN-system.md` §5.7 and the roadmap, with the
    decision trail preserved in git/PR #11). Rewired the roadmap's inbound links.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-01

### Changed
- Documentation & SDLC governance only (no runtime code changes):
  - Consolidated the release runbook into `docs/DESIGN-sdlc-cicd-release.md` (renamed
    from `GUIDE-cicd-release.md`) as the single SDLC + CI/CD + release design doc;
    documented both PyPI publish flows (OIDC default, token-driven fallback) and the CI
    validation matrix.
  - Baked branching + versioning rules into `CLAUDE.md` and the design doc: branch from
    `main`, PR strictly into `main` (no stacked branches); patch bump per PR merge,
    minor only for milestone PRs.
  - Marked the Tier-1 per-process-power feature shipped and corrected the roadmap.

### Added
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — weekly `pip` + `github-actions` dependency updates
  (grouped minor/patch to cut PR noise).
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — PR checklist mirroring the contributor guidelines
  (validation commands, Apple-Silicon run, functional-tests attestation).

### Security
- `SECURITY.md` — private vulnerability reporting policy scoped to actop's sudoless,
  in-process posture; documented enabling GitHub secret scanning + push protection as
  the redaction backstop for clones that never activated the local hooks.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Per-process power (`PWR`) column** in the process table — attributes package
  CPU power to each process by its share of total CPU-time (a partition that sums
  to the package CPU figure), the sudoless in-process answer to "which process is
  drawing the watts." Adds a `SORT_POWER` sort mode and a `Σ shown / pkg CPU`
  reconciliation token. Labelled an estimate: attribution is by wall CPU-time, so
  P-core work is under- and E-core work over-attributed vs. true watts. First
  sample / just-resumed rows render `–`, never a wrong `0.0`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **RAM readout no longer fabricates a fallback figure.** When the native memory
  read failed, `get_native_ram` returned a hardcoded `16 GB total / 8 GB
  available`, which the dashboard rendered as if it were real. It now returns a
  zero sentinel so the UI shows a visible `0/0 GB` ("unavailable") instead of a
  plausible-but-wrong value. (No divide-by-zero: the consumer already guards
  `total > 0`.)

### Changed
- Declare `rich` as a direct dependency (it is imported directly; previously it
  was only pulled in transitively via `textual`).

### Internal
- Remove unused `DashboardConfig` fields (`usage_track_window`,
  `core_history_window`, `max_media_bw`, `proc_filter_raw`) and the write-only
  `Monitor.backend_name`; name the chart-history buffer cap
  (`_CHART_HIST_MAXLEN`) and de-duplicate the bandwidth-percent calculation. No
  behavior change.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- **Renamed `agtop` → `actop`** ("Apple **C**hip top"). The previous name read as "Apple **G**PU top" and undersold a whole-chip monitor (CPU/GPU/ANE/memory/power/thermal); the rename also unblocks PyPI distribution (`pip install actop`), since the `agtop` name was unavailable. This is a clean break with **no backward-compatible `agtop` command, module, or formula** — the command, Python package, import path, Homebrew formula, and Prometheus metric prefix (`agtop_*` → `actop_*`) are now all `actop`. Existing Homebrew users: `brew uninstall agtop && brew untap binlecode/agtop`, then `brew tap binlecode/actop && brew install actop`.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **`/` filter no longer a dead control when the process table is hidden:** the regex filter only applies to the process table, but in `t`-off mode (the default) `/` still opened an input box whose pattern was never read — the polling loop skips process collection when the table is hidden. The `/  Filter` binding is now hidden from the footer and inert while the table is off, and reappears when `t` shows the table. (Filtering is reachable only with the table visible; `t` cannot be pressed mid-filter since the focused input captures it as text.)

## [0.9.6] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Esc cancels the process filter:** pressing `/` opens a live regex filter that previously could only be closed with `Enter` (committing the typed pattern). `Esc` now cancels the in-progress edit — discarding the typed text, reverting the live-applied filter to the value active before the field was opened, and restoring focus — matching the htop/vim/fzf cancel convention. `Enter` still commits as before.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Persistent core-topology header:** the Textual header sub-title now always shows the SoC core layout (e.g. `Apple M4 Max · 4E+12P+40GPU`), not just on the init splash — restoring the at-a-glance topology (including GPU core count) that the pre-Textual layout had. The `+NGPU` segment is omitted when the GPU core count is unavailable (unknown/future SoCs).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Live memory bandwidth:** total DRAM bandwidth is now sampled in-process and unprivileged from the IOReport `PMP/DCS BW` group, so the `Mem BW N GB/s` row is live instead of always hidden. The value is a residency-weighted average over the `AMCC` bandwidth-bucket histogram (summed across memory-controller dies), exposed via `SystemSnapshot.bandwidth_gbps`. Held within the idle-CPU budget by a per-state extraction filter in the IOReport delta path (extracts only the channels actually parsed).
- **uv install option:** `uv tool install` documented for non-Homebrew users — a sandboxed per-tool environment with its own managed CPython, no system Python required.

### Changed
- **Pinned kernel struct offsets:** the `proc_taskallinfo` byte offsets in `native_sys.py` are now named module constants with the struct layout documented in one place, and the native-process guard tests are hardened against silent offset drift on new macOS releases.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Memory-bandwidth chart + readout:** the unified-memory bandwidth sampled in `SystemSnapshot.bandwidth_gbps` (previously consumed only by the `BW>` alert) now has its own `Mem BW N GB/s` label and chart with rolling `avg/max` context — the headline saturation metric for LLM inference. The row hides itself on platforms that expose no bandwidth channel (`bandwidth_available` false), so no phantom `0 GB/s` is shown.
- **Package-power headline:** a `Package Power` label + chart for the total-SoC draw (CPU + GPU + ANE + other rails), alongside the existing CPU/GPU power charts. The figure already drove the `PKG>` alert but was never surfaced.
- **Session energy total:** the status line now carries an `energy` token — cumulative session energy integrated as ∫ package power dt since launch (rendered in mWh/Wh) — the live-TUI counterpart to `Profiler.total_package_joules`.

### Changed
- Test suite is now functional-only (enforced in `CLAUDE.md`): removed structural tests that asserted private helpers/internal state in isolation (`test_dashboard_stats.py`, two private-function tests in `test_braille_chart_render.py`); added `test_dashboard_metrics.py`, which mounts the real `HardwareDashboard` via Textual `App.run_test()` and drives the public `update_metrics` path with real `SystemSnapshot`s.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Color tier degradation + `NO_COLOR`:** chart colors no longer always emit truecolor `rgb()`. `resolve_color_mode()` honors `NO_COLOR` (https://no-color.org) unconditionally, then prefers the terminal's detected color system, falling back to `COLORTERM`/`TERM`. The blue→red gradient degrades to a 256-color cube index, a named 16-color severity ramp, or no style at all on dumb terminals — fixing broken output on limited/`NO_COLOR` terminals.
- **Chart time-window label:** charts plot one sample per column, so the visible span scaled silently with terminal width. The status line now leads with a `span <Ns/m/h>` token (chart width × `--interval`), documented in the `?` help overlay.

### Changed
- Consolidated all TUI design and implementation details into `docs/DESIGN-system.md` (Section 5) and removed the completed `docs/TODO-tui-modernization.md`. Section 5 was also brought current (removed stale `v`/`space` keys, added `?` help, color tiers, and headless export modes).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- The cur/avg/max chart context now appends the unit to each stat (`avg 31% · max 88%`, `avg 9.1W · max 18.7W`). A bare number was ambiguous next to a headline carrying a different unit — most notably the RAM row, whose headline is in GB while its avg/max are percent.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Chart context (cur/avg/max):** every metric label now shows a rolling average (over the `--avg` window) and the session peak alongside the live reading — e.g. `GPU 47% @1296MHz  avg 31 · max 88`. Percent metrics report `avg/max` in percent; power labels report watts. Covers the P/E-cluster summary rows and the GPU, ANE, RAM, and CPU/GPU power labels.
- **Help overlay (`?`):** a modal listing keybindings, metric-label meanings, and every status-line alert token (`THERMAL`, `BW>`, `PKG>`, `SWAP+`). Toggle with `?`, dismiss with `esc`/`q`.
- **Metrics export:** new `agtop/export.py` with two non-TUI backends. `--json` streams one NDJSON snapshot per interval to stdout (all `SystemSnapshot` fields, including per-core lists). `--serve PORT` runs a stdlib HTTP server exposing Prometheus gauges at `/metrics` (scalar gauges plus per-core `agtop_core_utilization_percent{cluster,core}`), kept warm by a background sampler so scrapes return immediately.

### Fixed
- Corrected the README interactive-keys reference, which still advertised the removed `v` (layout) and `space` (panel-collapse) bindings.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Simplified the status bar: removed the rarely-used layout toggle (`v`) and dashboard-collapse (`space`) bindings and disabled the framework command palette (`^p`), leaving a focused set: `q` `p` `s` `g` `t` `/`.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- The opening splash banner and the dashboard header now display the running version (e.g. `agtop v0.8.9`), sourced from a single `agtop.__version__`.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Hardened the native polling layer: removed dead BSD process structs, inlined the DVFS table passthrough, and added a sleep guard in `Monitor.get_snapshot` to avoid a frame with an inflated power scale.

### Changed
- Expanded the functional test suite (37 → 57 tests): added coverage for native process/DVFS parsing, the args→`DashboardConfig` merge, the SoC unknown-chip tier fallbacks, and the power-chart auto/profile scaling modes.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Simplified Homebrew tap by removing pre-compiled binary bottling and moving to a pure, high-efficiency native source-build distribution model.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Highly optimized native process scanning by introducing a two-tier lazy/on-demand KERN_PROCARGS2 lookup. This reduces process polling latency from 254ms to 21ms (a 91.5% speedup) and decreases peak heap allocations, making agtop incredibly battery-friendly.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-06-14

### Removed
- Removed `psutil` dependency across the entire codebase, making `agtop` 100% zero-dependency for process and memory monitoring.

### Changed
- Migrated RAM/swap calculations to Mach native `host_statistics64` and `sysctlbyname("vm.swapusage")` APIs, correcting over-reporting of memory and matching Activity Monitor precisely.
- Migrated process scanning to native `proc_listpids` and `proc_pidinfo` APIs with custom offset unpacking, reducing process traversal latency from 49ms to 5ms (a 10x speedup) and peak heap memory allocation by 96%.
- Added support for KERN_PROCARGS2 sysctl to parse full process command lines natively on macOS, maintaining full backwards compatibility for argument-level regex process filtering.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Reorganized SDLC documentation (architecture reviews, TUI research, and operations guidelines) into a dedicated `docs/` folder.
- Added `tmp/` folder to `.gitignore` to keep scratch and workspace files untracked.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- Per-core inline spark rendering now uses the same shared chart glyph utility path as `BrailleChart`, so `dots`/`block` mode behavior is consistent and duplicate glyph logic is removed.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- New TUI keybinding `v` toggles the main layout between horizontal (side-by-side) and vertical (stacked) when viewing hardware and processes.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- `BrailleChart` vertical-line coloring now uses a single color per sample column, derived from the current reading, instead of row-height gradient segments within a column.
- `RAM` chart now uses the same vertical scale (`height: 4`) as `P-CPU` and `E-CPU` charts.
- Charts now support two glyph modes: `dots` (braille) and `block` (square), switchable by CLI (`--chart-glyph`) or at runtime with the `g` key.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- Process panel is now excluded by default at startup. Top-process sampling is skipped until the panel is enabled.

### Added
- New CLI flag `--show-processes` to enable the process panel at launch.
- New TUI keybinding `t` to toggle the process panel on/off at runtime.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- E-core cluster indices were offset by `p_count`, causing E-core metrics to be attributed to non-existent cores on chips with more than 4 P-cores.

### Changed
- `BrailleChart` rewritten: 1 sample per character, filled vertical pole from zero to value, blue→red gradient coloring per row segment. Replaces the old 2-samples-per-char alternating left/right dot design.
- P-CPU and E-CPU charts increased to height 4 (16 levels); other charts remain height 2 (8 levels).
- Layout: hardware dashboard and process table now split side-by-side in a horizontal container.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Correct GPU energy channel matching: use `"GPU Energy" in item.channel` instead of `"GPU" in item.channel` to avoid double-counting the mJ summary and nJ precision channels on M4 (and later) chips.

### Changed
- Power charts (`CPU Power`, `GPU Power`) now use `auto_scale=True` so low idle wattage is visible instead of rounding to zero in the braille bar math.
- Removed dead `clear_console()` function from `utils.py` (never called).
- Deleted stale `agtop/tui/styles.tcss` (superseded by `DEFAULT_CSS` embedded in `AgtopApp` since v0.5.1).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Thermal pressure now reads real macOS state (`NSProcessInfo.thermalState` via ObjC runtime ctypes) instead of always showing "Unknown". Returns Nominal / Fair / Serious / Critical.

### Changed
- Replaced Textual `Sparkline` with a custom `BrailleChart` widget: auto-scales bar count to terminal width (2 samples per character column), 500-sample rolling history.
- Added loading splash screen with chip name, core counts, interval, and a braille spinner while the sampler warms up on the first delta.
- Process table row count now adapts to available table height instead of a fixed limit.
- Core-row layout now adapts column count to widget width; entries separated by `│` with fixed-width formatting.
- Reduced chart height from 3 to 2 terminal rows for a more compact layout.
- Thread count column added to process table.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Embedded TUI CSS as `DEFAULT_CSS` in `AgtopApp` instead of a `CSS_PATH` file reference. `styles.tcss` was not included in the wheel, causing a `StylesheetError` crash on `brew install`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Replaced the `dashing` + `blessed` terminal dashboard with a [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) TUI. All charts are now braille `Sparkline` widgets; layout is declarative CSS; resize is clean.
- Per-core activity now sourced from IOReport CPU Core Performance States via `CoreSample` dataclass instead of `psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)`.
- Removed `--color` and `--core-view` CLI flags (subsumed by Textual's automatic color support and always-on sparkline history charts).

### Added
- Interactive runtime keys: `/` to open a live regex filter for processes, `s` to cycle sort (CPU% → RSS → PID), `p` to pause/resume polling, `space` to collapse the hardware panel.
- `--version` flag: `agtop --version` now prints the installed package version.
- `agtop/config.py`: extracted `DashboardConfig` frozen dataclass and `create_dashboard_config()` from the deleted `state.py`.
- `agtop/models.py`: `SystemSnapshot` and `CoreSample` dataclasses (public API).
- `agtop/api.py`: `Monitor`, `Profiler`, `AsyncMonitor` — public Python API for hardware profiling (programmatic use without TUI).
- `agtop/tui/`: Textual TUI package (`app.py`, `widgets.py`, `styles.tcss`).

### Removed
- Deleted legacy modules: `agtop/state.py`, `agtop/updaters.py`, `agtop/input.py`, `agtop/color_modes.py`, `agtop/gradient.py`.
- Removed `dashing` dependency from `pyproject.toml`; replaced with `textual>=0.60`.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Fixed GitHub Actions CI failure by correctly marking hardware-dependent E2E tests as macOS local-only.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Replaced `test_input.py`, `test_state.py`, `test_updaters.py` with `test_e2e.py` and `test_integration.py` (QA test suite overhaul).
- Removed completed `TODO-agtop-improvements.md` planning document.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Raised minimum history buffer size from 20 to 200 points (`usage_track_window`, `core_history_window` in `state.py`). Charts now fill with real data at default `--avg 30 --interval 2` settings instead of repeating the oldest sample across most of the chart width.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Adaptive widget title truncation: when terminal width is < 100 columns, the four long panel titles (`power_charts`, `cpu_power_chart`, `gpu_power_chart`, `memory_bandwidth_panel`) switch to compact forms that fit without mid-word clipping, while still showing key wattage and bandwidth values.
- Terminal resize awareness: render loop now uses `terminal.notify_on_resize()` and `InteractiveState.resize_pending` to trigger a full-clear redraw on resize; display is skipped when the terminal reports a degenerate size (< 2 cols/rows).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Replaced all `os.popen("sysctl ...")`, `subprocess.run(["sysctl" ...])`, `subprocess.run(["ioreg" ...])`, and `system_profiler` shell calls with direct `ctypes` bindings to `libSystem.B.dylib`, `IOKit`, and `CoreFoundation`.
- Added `agtop/native_sys.py`: `get_sysctl_int`, `get_sysctl_string` (via `sysctlbyname`), `get_gpu_cores_native` (via `AGXAccelerator` IORegistry property), and `get_dvfs_tables_native` (via `IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperties` + `CFData` byte extraction, replacing `ioreg` XML/plist pipeline).
- Removed `import subprocess` and `import plistlib` from `sampler.py`; GPU core count and DVFS table reads now complete in microseconds instead of ~250 ms at startup.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Added runtime keyboard input: `q` to quit, `c`/`m`/`p` to toggle process sort by CPU%, RSS, or PID.
- Added sort indicator (`*`) in process column header and sort label in panel title.
- Added `agtop/input.py` module with `InteractiveState`, `handle_keypress()`, and `sort_processes()`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
- Extracted `DashboardState` and `DashboardConfig` dataclasses into `agtop/state.py` and metric/widget update functions into `agtop/updaters.py`, slimming `_run_dashboard()` to a focused render loop.
- Added `--subsamples` CLI option for sampler-level smoothing via multi-delta averaging within each interval.
- Added cross-platform tests for state factories, metric updates, and widget binding.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Added SMC temperature reader (`agtop/smc.py`) for CPU and GPU die temperatures via IOKit ctypes, no sudo required.
- Added CPU and GPU temperature display in gauge titles (e.g. "P-CPU Usage: 12% @ 3504 MHz (58°C)").

### Changed
- Replaced `vm_stat` subprocess with `psutil.virtual_memory()` for RAM metrics, eliminating fork/exec overhead every sample interval.
- Split test suite into CI-safe and macOS-local groups using pytest markers.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Added `GradientText` widget for per-line gradient coloring in the process panel based on CPU utilization.

### Changed
- Changed default `--interval` from 1s to 2s to reduce sampling overhead (aligned with btop's default).
- Changed default `--show_cores` to on for a full per-core dashboard out of the box (disable with `--no-show_cores`).
- Changed default `--power-scale` from `auto` to `profile` for stable, meaningful power chart percentages from the first frame.
- Replaced `psutil.virtual_memory()` with `os.sysconf` for total RAM and `vm_stat` for used RAM; psutil retained for swap and process metrics.
- Rewrote README with consolidated structure: Key Features, How It Works (OS-level API mechanism), Architecture (Mermaid system diagram), and Signal Sources.
- Revised release operations guide as combined tutorial and runbook.

### Fixed
- Fixed RAM usage to match Activity Monitor by using macOS `vm_stat` page counts (`internal - purgeable + wired + compressor`) instead of psutil's `total - available` which over-reports usage.
- Fixed swap percent calculation to use raw byte values instead of pre-rounded GB values.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-02-16
