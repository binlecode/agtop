# Changelog

All notable changes to `binlecode/agtop` should be documented in this file.

This project follows a Keep a Changelog-style format and uses version tags for releases.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- E-core cluster indices were offset by `p_count`, causing E-core metrics to be attributed to non-existent cores on chips with more than 4 P-cores.

### Changed
- `BrailleChart` rewritten: 1 sample per character, filled vertical pole from zero to value, blue→red gradient coloring per row segment. Replaces the old 2-samples-per-char alternating left/right dot design.
- P-CPU and E-CPU charts increased to height 4 (16 levels); other charts remain height 2 (8 levels).
- Layout: hardware dashboard and process table now split side-by-side in a horizontal container.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Correct GPU energy channel matching: use `"GPU Energy" in item.channel` instead of `"GPU" in item.channel` to avoid double-counting the mJ summary and nJ precision channels on M4 (and later) chips.

### Changed
- Power charts (`CPU Power`, `GPU Power`) now use `auto_scale=True` so low idle wattage is visible instead of rounding to zero in the braille bar math.
- Removed dead `clear_console()` function from `utils.py` (never called).
- Deleted stale `agtop/tui/styles.tcss` (superseded by `DEFAULT_CSS` embedded in `AgtopApp` since v0.5.1).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Thermal pressure now reads real macOS state (`NSProcessInfo.thermalState` via ObjC runtime ctypes) instead of always showing "Unknown". Returns Nominal / Fair / Serious / Critical.

### Changed
- Replaced Textual `Sparkline` with a custom `BrailleChart` widget: auto-scales bar count to terminal width (2 samples per character column), 500-sample rolling history.
- Added loading splash screen with chip name, core counts, interval, and a braille spinner while the sampler warms up on the first delta.
- Process table row count now adapts to available table height instead of a fixed limit.
- Core-row layout now adapts column count to widget width; entries separated by `│` with fixed-width formatting.
- Reduced chart height from 3 to 2 terminal rows for a more compact layout.
- Thread count column added to process table.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Embedded TUI CSS as `DEFAULT_CSS` in `AgtopApp` instead of a `CSS_PATH` file reference. `styles.tcss` was not included in the wheel, causing a `StylesheetError` crash on `brew install`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Replaced the `dashing` + `blessed` terminal dashboard with a [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) TUI. All charts are now braille `Sparkline` widgets; layout is declarative CSS; resize is clean.
- Per-core activity now sourced from IOReport CPU Core Performance States via `CoreSample` dataclass instead of `psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)`.
- Removed `--color` and `--core-view` CLI flags (subsumed by Textual's automatic color support and always-on sparkline history charts).

### Added
- Interactive runtime keys: `/` to open a live regex filter for processes, `s` to cycle sort (CPU% → RSS → PID), `p` to pause/resume polling, `space` to collapse the hardware panel.
- `--version` flag: `agtop --version` now prints the installed package version.
- `agtop/config.py`: extracted `DashboardConfig` frozen dataclass and `create_dashboard_config()` from the deleted `state.py`.
- `agtop/models.py`: `SystemSnapshot` and `CoreSample` dataclasses (public API).
- `agtop/api.py`: `Monitor`, `Profiler`, `AsyncMonitor` — public Python API for hardware profiling (programmatic use without TUI).
- `agtop/tui/`: Textual TUI package (`app.py`, `widgets.py`, `styles.tcss`).

### Removed
- Deleted legacy modules: `agtop/state.py`, `agtop/updaters.py`, `agtop/input.py`, `agtop/color_modes.py`, `agtop/gradient.py`.
- Removed `dashing` dependency from `pyproject.toml`; replaced with `textual>=0.60`.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Fixed GitHub Actions CI failure by correctly marking hardware-dependent E2E tests as macOS local-only.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Replaced `test_input.py`, `test_state.py`, `test_updaters.py` with `test_e2e.py` and `test_integration.py` (QA test suite overhaul).
- Removed completed `TODO-agtop-improvements.md` planning document.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Raised minimum history buffer size from 20 to 200 points (`usage_track_window`, `core_history_window` in `state.py`). Charts now fill with real data at default `--avg 30 --interval 2` settings instead of repeating the oldest sample across most of the chart width.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Adaptive widget title truncation: when terminal width is < 100 columns, the four long panel titles (`power_charts`, `cpu_power_chart`, `gpu_power_chart`, `memory_bandwidth_panel`) switch to compact forms that fit without mid-word clipping, while still showing key wattage and bandwidth values.
- Terminal resize awareness: render loop now uses `terminal.notify_on_resize()` and `InteractiveState.resize_pending` to trigger a full-clear redraw on resize; display is skipped when the terminal reports a degenerate size (< 2 cols/rows).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Replaced all `os.popen("sysctl ...")`, `subprocess.run(["sysctl" ...])`, `subprocess.run(["ioreg" ...])`, and `system_profiler` shell calls with direct `ctypes` bindings to `libSystem.B.dylib`, `IOKit`, and `CoreFoundation`.
- Added `agtop/native_sys.py`: `get_sysctl_int`, `get_sysctl_string` (via `sysctlbyname`), `get_gpu_cores_native` (via `AGXAccelerator` IORegistry property), and `get_dvfs_tables_native` (via `IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperties` + `CFData` byte extraction, replacing `ioreg` XML/plist pipeline).
- Removed `import subprocess` and `import plistlib` from `sampler.py`; GPU core count and DVFS table reads now complete in microseconds instead of ~250 ms at startup.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Added runtime keyboard input: `q` to quit, `c`/`m`/`p` to toggle process sort by CPU%, RSS, or PID.
- Added sort indicator (`*`) in process column header and sort label in panel title.
- Added `agtop/input.py` module with `InteractiveState`, `handle_keypress()`, and `sort_processes()`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
- Extracted `DashboardState` and `DashboardConfig` dataclasses into `agtop/state.py` and metric/widget update functions into `agtop/updaters.py`, slimming `_run_dashboard()` to a focused render loop.
- Added `--subsamples` CLI option for sampler-level smoothing via multi-delta averaging within each interval.
- Added cross-platform tests for state factories, metric updates, and widget binding.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Added SMC temperature reader (`agtop/smc.py`) for CPU and GPU die temperatures via IOKit ctypes, no sudo required.
- Added CPU and GPU temperature display in gauge titles (e.g. "P-CPU Usage: 12% @ 3504 MHz (58°C)").

### Changed
- Replaced `vm_stat` subprocess with `psutil.virtual_memory()` for RAM metrics, eliminating fork/exec overhead every sample interval.
- Split test suite into CI-safe and macOS-local groups using pytest markers.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Added `GradientText` widget for per-line gradient coloring in the process panel based on CPU utilization.

### Changed
- Changed default `--interval` from 1s to 2s to reduce sampling overhead (aligned with btop's default).
- Changed default `--show_cores` to on for a full per-core dashboard out of the box (disable with `--no-show_cores`).
- Changed default `--power-scale` from `auto` to `profile` for stable, meaningful power chart percentages from the first frame.
- Replaced `psutil.virtual_memory()` with `os.sysconf` for total RAM and `vm_stat` for used RAM; psutil retained for swap and process metrics.
- Rewrote README with consolidated structure: Key Features, How It Works (OS-level API mechanism), Architecture (Mermaid system diagram), and Signal Sources.
- Revised release operations guide as combined tutorial and runbook.

### Fixed
- Fixed RAM usage to match Activity Monitor by using macOS `vm_stat` page counts (`internal - purgeable + wired + compressor`) instead of psutil's `total - available` which over-reports usage.
- Fixed swap percent calculation to use raw byte values instead of pre-rounded GB values.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-02-16

Initial IOReport-only release. All prior versions used a legacy backend and are not documented here.
