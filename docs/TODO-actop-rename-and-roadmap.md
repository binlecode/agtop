# TODO — `actop` rename + `*top`-driven differentiation roadmap

Status: **Part A (rename) — ✅ DONE.** Released as `v1.0.0` on 2026-06-30: tag pushed,
PyPI published via OIDC, Homebrew tap synced, and validated with a real local
`brew install`. **Part B (feature roadmap) is the only remaining open work.** This is
the single source of truth for (A) the `agtop → actop` rename and (B) the
mission-specific feature roadmap that justifies staying a `*top`.

> **What shipped vs. the original plan (deviations):**
> - **Clean break, no `agtop` alias.** No deprecated `agtop` command, module, or
>   formula shim — the command/package/import/formula/Prometheus prefix are all
>   `actop`. (Maintainer decision: simpler, pre-PyPI user base is tiny.)
> - **Version `1.0.0`** (not the suggested `0.10.0`) to mark the milestone.
> - **Prometheus metric prefix renamed** `agtop_*` → `actop_*`.
> - **Formula moved to a dedicated tap repo** `binlecode/homebrew-actop` (not kept
>   in this repo) so `main` can be strictly PR-only — CI never pushes to `main`.
> - **`main` is now branch-protected** (PR-only, `enforce_admins`, no force-push)
>   plus a local `.githooks/pre-push` guard.
> - **All release actions completed (2026-06-30):** tagged `v1.0.0`, `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`
>   secret configured, PyPI published via OIDC trusted publishing, Homebrew tap synced,
>   local `brew install` validated. Only soft follow-up left: **announce**.

## Mission (first principles)

> **The complete, sudoless Apple-Silicon `*top` — it shows what no other monitor does.**

`actop` stays a live terminal monitor you *watch* (the `*top` use case). It wins not by
leaving the category but by **covering the whole chip and surfacing decision-grade
signals the others can't** — per-process power, bandwidth saturation, throttle state,
DVFS residency — all **in-process and without `sudo`**. The Python API
(`Monitor`/`Profiler`, `to_pandas()`) stays as the programmable layer underneath, not
the headline.

Positioning line: *"the Apple-Silicon `*top` that answers the questions the others
can't — which process is drawing the watts, am I memory-bandwidth-bound, am I being
throttled right now."*

# Part A — Rename `agtop → actop`

### Why
- `agtop` = "Apple **G**PU top" — **too narrow** (we monitor CPU/GPU/ANE/mem/power/thermal).
- `actop` = "Apple **C**hip top" — whole-chip, on-mission; plus a second reading **AC = power**.
- Keeps the `a_top` lineage and brand cadence (one-letter evolution `g → c`).
- **Namespaces are clear:** PyPI `actop` free, Homebrew core `actop` free, GitHub
  `binlecode/actop` free (only a dead 0★ `dlhx5326/actop`, last pushed 2019 — non-blocking).
- Fixes the real blocker: PyPI `agtop` is squatted by an unrelated tool, so
  `pip install agtop` is impossible. `pip install actop` / `pipx install actop` becomes ours.
- `atop` (1k★ Linux monitor) adjacency is **unchanged** — `agtop` and `actop` are both
  `atop`+one consonant, equidistant; no *new* confusion risk. Accepted.

### Rename surfaces (checklist)
- [x] **GitHub repo**: renamed `binlecode/agtop → binlecode/actop` (GitHub auto-redirects old URLs/clones); local remote updated.
- [x] **Python package**: `agtop/ → actop/`; `pyproject.toml` `[project].name`/`version`(`1.0.0`)/`urls`/`scripts` (`actop = "actop.actop:cli"`) and `packages.find` all updated.
- [x] **Internal imports / module paths**: `agtop.*` → `actop.*` across the package and `tests/`; `AgtopApp` → `ActopApp`; Prometheus prefix `agtop_*` → `actop_*`.
- [x] **CLI command**: primary command is `actop`. **No `agtop` alias** — clean break (no deprecated console-script).
- [x] **Homebrew**: `class Actop`, new repo `url`/test. **Formula moved out of this repo** to the dedicated tap `binlecode/homebrew-actop` (no in-repo `Formula/` for releases; no `agtop` shim).
- [x] **CI**: `main-ci.yml` (now also runs on `pull_request`), `release-formula.yml` (syncs into the tap repo via `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`), `scripts/tag_release.sh`, and `docs/GUIDE-cicd-release.md` updated.
- [x] **PyPI publish wiring**: added `publish-pypi.yml` using **Trusted Publishing (GitHub OIDC)**, `skip-existing`. _Actual claim/publish pending maintainer token + pending-publisher setup._
- [x] **README**: name, positioning, install commands, name-origin ("Apple **C**hip top"), `asitop` reframed as inspiration only.
- [x] **Docs + project memory**: swept `docs/` (this roadmap excepted); `CLAUDE.md` overview + module paths updated; memory notes added (`no-direct-main-push`, `git-identity`).
- [x] **Assets**: renamed `images/agtop.png → images/actop.png` and updated references.

### Sequencing
1. ~~Rename GitHub repo~~ ✅ (redirects keep old links alive).
2. ~~Code/package rename + tests green~~ ✅ (`ruff` clean, 86 tests pass; no alias).
3. ~~Formula/CI/tag-script updates~~ ✅ (+ formula relocated to tap repo).
4. ~~Cut the rename release~~ ✅ — tagged `v1.0.0` on 2026-06-30; `release-formula` + `publish-pypi` both green.
5. ~~PyPI~~ ✅ — `actop` 1.0.0 live on PyPI via OIDC trusted publishing.
6. ~~Update README/docs/positioning~~ ✅; **announce** pending.

Release completed 2026-06-30 via `scripts/tag_release.sh 1.0.0`: PyPI (OIDC) and the
Homebrew tap sync are both green, `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` is configured, and a local
`brew install` was validated. Only soft follow-up left: **announce**.

### Risks / notes
- In-flight `0.9.x` releases: rename landed on a clean tree, not interleaved with a release. ✅
- Tap users: GitHub redirect covers old links; the one-time switch is
  `brew uninstall agtop && brew untap binlecode/agtop && brew tap binlecode/actop && brew install actop`.
- One-way-ish door (PyPI name, brew formula): done deliberately in one PR (#1).
- `main` is now strictly PR-only (branch protection + pre-push hook); the release
  formula sync writes to the **tap repo**, never to `main`.

# Part B — `*top`-driven feature differentiation (the white space)

Each item: **what · why it's white space · data/module to build on · effort · acceptance.**
Everything below is feasible on the existing **sudoless in-process** stack.

## Tier 1 — headline differentiators (build on what exists; ship these as "why actop")

### 1. Per-process power / energy attribution ⭐ *the flagship*
- **What**: an **Energy/Power column** in the process table — "which process is drawing the watts."
- **Why white space**: asitop/mactop/macmon/silitop show *system-total* power and a CPU%/RSS process list; **none attributes power/energy per process**. This is Activity Monitor's "Energy Impact," but in a sudoless TUI — nobody does it.
- **Build on**: `native_sys.py` (already does native proc introspection via `proc_taskallinfo`) → add `task_power_info` / rusage energy counters; surface through `utils.py` process collection → `models.py` (`ProcessInfo` energy field) → `tui/widgets.py` process rows; include in `export.py`.
- **Effort**: M–L (native struct work; per-process *CPU* energy is readily available, per-process *GPU* is the stretch in Tier 2).
- **Acceptance**: process table shows a per-process energy/power figure that tracks a known busy process (e.g. an inference run) and sums sanely toward package power.

### 2. Bandwidth as % of SoC peak + saturation indicator ⭐ *the LLM answer*
- **What**: render memory bandwidth not just as GB/s but as **% of this chip's theoretical peak**, with a saturation/`MEM-BOUND` indicator.
- **Why white space**: most tools omit bandwidth entirely; none frames it as the *"am I memory-bandwidth-bound?"* decision metric that governs LLM inference.
- **Build on**: existing `bandwidth_gbps` (sampler/models) ÷ reference peak bandwidth in `soc_profiles.py` (add a `peak_bandwidth_gbps` field per profile if not present); display in `tui/widgets.py`; reuse the alert path for a `MEM-BOUND` state.
- **Effort**: S–M (data already sampled).
- **Acceptance**: on a bandwidth-heavy workload, the % climbs toward 100% of the SoC's known peak and the saturation indicator fires.

### 3. Thermal-throttle indicator
- **What**: an explicit **`THROTTLING`** state — "GPU/CPU capped at N% of max frequency right now," not just a temperature number.
- **Why white space**: everyone shows temps; **nobody clearly says you're being throttled** and by how much.
- **Build on**: per-core/GPU current frequency (sampler/models) vs max freq from `soc_profiles.py`; correlate with die temps from `smc.py`; surface via the existing alert/status path in `tui/widgets.py`.
- **Effort**: S–M.
- **Acceptance**: under sustained load that induces throttling, the indicator reflects the frequency cap; clears when thermals recover.

## Tier 2 — deep-silicon signals (unique to in-process IOReport; harder)

### 4. DVFS P-state residency distribution
- **What**: per-cluster **time-in-each-frequency-state** histogram (how the silicon actually behaved, not just instantaneous freq).
- **Why white space**: only your in-process IOReport access makes this cheap; powermetrics-based tools (asitop/silitop) can't easily match it.
- **Build on**: the **DVFS table discovery already in `sampler.py`** + residency data in `ioreport.py`; new compact widget in `tui/widgets.py`.
- **Effort**: M.
- **Acceptance**: residency distribution shifts toward high-freq states under load and idle states at rest.

### 5. Per-process GPU / ANE attribution (stretch)
- **What**: extend #1 to GPU/ANE share per process.
- **Why white space + caveat**: nobody does it; macOS exposes per-process GPU only partially → expect **approximate** attribution. Ship clearly labeled as estimated.
- **Effort**: L (research-y).

## Tier 3 — completeness parity (secondary; NOT white space)
Network I/O, disk I/O, fan RPM, SSD/battery temps. mactop/silitop already have these — they're *parity*, not differentiation. Add only after Tier 1–2; don't let them displace the wins.

## Supporting (keep, don't headline)
- **Python API** (`api.py` `Monitor`/`Profiler`, `to_pandas()`) and **exports** (`export.py` NDJSON/Prometheus) stay — they *feed* the differentiators (e.g. per-process energy in exports, workload correlation via an optional `Profiler.mark()`).

## Explicit non-goals (scope discipline)
- **Stay a terminal `*top`** — no menu-bar app, no web UI.
- **Silicon-focused** — we instrument the *chip*, not the whole box; Tier-3 system metrics are parity-only.
- Not a capture/replay oscilloscope (that was the abandoned `siliscope` direction) — `actop` is a live monitor.

## Update the comparison table
Add rows to README `## Where agtop fits` for the white-space metrics so the table reads
as "things **only actop** has": **per-process power/energy**, **bandwidth % of peak**,
**throttle state**, **DVFS residency**.

# Suggested overall order
1. **Rename to `actop`** (Part A) — clears install friction + sets the brand.
2. Ship **Tier 1** (#1–#3) under the new name as the launch story ("the `*top` that shows what others don't").
3. Then **Tier 2** (#4–#5); **Tier 3** only as parity demand arises.
